Stylefindr
Steffi Ostrowski, 2011/2012

Stylefindr is an experimental fashion comparison shopping site. The concept and code are very much still unfinished, but the basic idea is a comparison shopping site dedicated to fashion - a more efficient "one stop shopping" based on an algorithm that matches products from different sites.  

Perhaps the most important function of this project is to help me with my web development skills as I'm teaching myself RoR.
